#this operator will track a relationship such as the red object inside of the pantry
#until the relationship is true

# the operator needs the object ids ^a <obja> and ^b <objb> as well as the preposition
# ^prep <prep>

#sp {*propose*svs-tracking
#   (state <s> -^track-result
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> +)
#   (<o> ^name svs-tracking
#        ^category svs
#        ^a <obja>
#        ^b <objb>
#        ^prep right-of)
#}

# the operator will return ^track-result to the superstate once complete.
# This will be ^track-result success if the relationship is now true
# or ^track-result.failure prep-not-found if the preposition cannot be found

# The second version of tracking works as an elaboration on the top state
# to track something put on the topstate:

#sp {*svs-tracking
#   (state <s> ^topstate <s>
#              ^object <a>
#              ^object <b>)
#-->
#   (<s> ^track-relation <relation>)
#   (<relation> ^object1 <a>
#               ^object2  <b>
#               ^found-prep <fprep>)
#}

# <fprep> should be looked up with operator lookup-prepositon
# When the tracking relation is true <relation> will have ^complete success.
# To end tracking remove track-relation from topstate
# you can track multiple relationships at the same time

# If their is a failure, ie the preposition is not found, the <relation> will
# contain ^failure prep-not-found.
