# find-relations is a query operator used to get all the exisiting spatial relationships
# that the given object participates in
# Below is an example of a proposal for a find-relations operator for all objects 
# right-of object id 0

#sp {relation-question*propose*find-relations
#   (state <s> ^topstate <s>
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> +)
#   (<o> ^name find-relations
#        ^category svs
#        ^prep right-of
#        ^interaction << true false >>
#        ^ind 2
#		 ^obj <id>
#}

# interaction is optional and by default set to false

# The find-relations will add a ^relationships WME to the state
# ^relationships will contain ^with <original-obj-id>, ^preposition right-of 
# and a ^relations WME for each match, containing ^name <prepositon> and ^obj <id>

# ind indicates the position in the relationship right-of with ind 1 would find all the 
# objects that object 0 is right of

# If the find-relations find no relationships the ^relationships response will contain
# ^failure none-found

#If find-relations does not find the preposition used the ^relationships response
#contains ^failure prep-not-found
