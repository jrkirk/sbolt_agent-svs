# find-relations is a query operator used to get all the exisiting spatial relationships
# that the given object participates in
# Below is an example of a proposal for a find-relations operator to the relations for object id 0
#sp {relation-question*propose*find-relations
#   (state <s> ^topstate <s>
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> +)
#   (<o> ^name find-relations
#        ^category svs
#		 ^obj <id>
#}

# The find-relations will add a ^relationships WME to the operator
# ^relationships will contain ^relations WME for each match, containing ^name <prepositon> and ^obj <id>
