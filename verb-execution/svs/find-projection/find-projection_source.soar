# find-projection is a query operator used to get a fixed coordinate for a projection
# of a learned preposition and two objects
# Below is an example of a proposal for a find-projection operator

#sp {*propose*find-projection
#   (state <s> -^projection-result
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> + =)
#   (<o> ^name find-projection
#        ^category svs
#        ^interaction << true false >>
#        ^a <obja>
#        ^b <objb>
#        ^type <prep>)
#}

# This corresponds to the sentence "put <obja> to the <prep> of <objb>" where
# <obj> corresponds to the topstate objects and <prep> to the word (ie right-of)
#
# interaction is optional and by default set to false

# The find-projection will add a ^projection-result WME to the calling state
# ^projection-result will contain ^x <x> ^y <y> ^z <z> when successful 
# otherwise ^projection-result will be failure
#
# additionally the failure reason will be added to the superstate
# ^proj-failure-reason << no-prep no-object >>
