Soar agents for BOLT project at UMichigan.

- =interaction=: implements the interaction-stack and related
  operators
- =simple-agent=: implements primitive actions pick-up, goto, put-down
  etc. only used for sanity check.
- =topchef-soar=: implements kitchen-domain primitive actions goto, pick-up,
  put-down,
- =verb-execution=: integrates primitive domain actions with interaction
- =topchef-soar.soar=: random primitive actions
- =verb-execution.soar=: interaction, verb-execution, topchef-soar

Note: =verb-execution.soar=: now depends on parses generated by
LGSoar. Objects in the perceptual field need to be un-ambiguous (wrt
shape, which is also assumed to be the name (bolt.config in
abolt/config should work)).

Following action command sentence sequence has been tested with LGSoar and
interaction-stack and the agent performs as expected.
