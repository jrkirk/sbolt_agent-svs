### the agent uses background knowledge of interactive dialog to assign purpose to instructor-messages.


## case 1 verb-commands: the purpose of the instructor is for the agent to act the command in the environment.

 sp {elaborate*instructor-message*purpose*case1
    (state <s> ^topstate <s>
	       ^instructor-message <m>)
    (<m> ^type verb-command
    	 ^information <info>)
 -->
    (<m> ^purpose <p>)
    (<p> ^type external-action
    	 ^satisfaction <sat>)
    (<sat> ^action-event <info>
    	   ^learning-event explanation)
 }


 ### case 2 indication of a successful completion: the purpose of the instructor is to indicate that the current action being pursued is successfully completed, and hence an explanation of that composite operator is in order

 sp {elaborate*instructor-message*purpose*case2
    (state <s> ^topstate <s>
	       ^instructor-message <m>)
    (<m> ^event-type successful-completion)
 -->
    (<m> ^purpose <p>)
    (<p> ^type explanation
    	 ^satisfaction <sat>)
    (<sat> ^learning-event explanation)
 }
