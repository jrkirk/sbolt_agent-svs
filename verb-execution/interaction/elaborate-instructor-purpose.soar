### the agent uses background knowledge of interactive dialog to assign purpose to instructor-messages.


## case 1 verb-commands: the purpose of the instructor is for the agent to act the command in the environment.

### case 2 indication of a successful completion: the purpose of the instructor is to indicate that the current action being pursued is successfully completed, and hence an explanation of that composite operator is in order

    	 ^satisfaction <sat>)
    
     # AM: Changed the satisfaction structure
    (<sat> ^learning-event.type explanation)
