# This operator is a general-purpose operator which generates a
# natural language representation that can be used when sending
# messages to the user

# Usage:
# (<s> ^operator <o> +)
# (<o> ^name describe-object
#      ^object <obj>)
# Note: <obj> is an internal representation of the object from the topstate 
#    (<topstate> ^object <obj>)
     
# Result: 
# Creates a description structure on the operator (o-supported)
# (<o> ^description <desc>)
# (<desc> ^adjective <adj1> ^adjective <adj2> ^word <word>)
# Where there will be any number of adjectives and then the base word (noun)

# For each visual property we look up the english word associated with the internal label

# We also determine the 'name' or base noun for the object
